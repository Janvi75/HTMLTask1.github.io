    <h2> HTML</h2>
    <img src="images/html5.png" alt="html5">
    <p> The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in
      a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as
      JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
      multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the
      appearance of the document. </p>
    <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
      interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by
      denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. </p>

    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <img src="images/css3.png" alt="css">
    <p> Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a
      markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
      JavaScript.</p>
    <p> CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3]
      This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
      presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
      separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to
      be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
